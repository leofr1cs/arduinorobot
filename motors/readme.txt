Make sure you connect the motor pins to the appropriate Arduino digital pins. In this example, Motor A is connected to pins 2, 3, and 9 (in1, in2, and enA respectively), while Motor B is connected to pins 4, 5, and 10 (in3, in4, and enB respectively).

The setup() function sets the motor pins as outputs. The loop() function demonstrates different movements by calling the respective functions and adding delays between each movement.

The movement functions (moveForward(), moveBackward(), turnLeft(), turnRight(), and stopMotors()) control the motor directions and PWM speed using the digital and analog write functions.

Once you upload this code to your Arduino board and connect the motors properly, the buggy should move forward, backward, turn left, turn right, and stop in a loop.
